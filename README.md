# Fast-Fashion

This React app allows users to use one query to browse products from multiple
online retailers--think Kayak for clothes. Users simply enter in their search term
and the app generates iframes from different retailers as if the user had
used those retailers' search forms. Users can see at a glance what some
familiar brands carry.

This project employs React Router as means to show different components without having to reload the entire page. I wanted to create a fast and easy shopping experience with a seamless UI.
